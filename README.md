# Terminal Clue

## Things that I need to do to build Clue: 
- Make lists for: 
    - Characters :white_check_mark:
    - Weapons :white_check_mark:
    - Rooms :white_check_mark:
- Make the gameboard navigatable.
    - Players can only move to rooms adjacent to the room that they are in at the beginning of their turn or through one of the corner secret passages. 
- Generate a random murder :white_check_mark:
- Allow players to make suggestions
- Allow players to make an accusation and end the game. 


## Possibles: 
- Make a guess card like the paper versions 

## Questions: 
- Will the computer make suggestions? 
- How or will there be card hints like in the board game? 

## Variances from real Clue
- No hallways or dice rolls
