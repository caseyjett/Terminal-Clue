# Terminal Clue

### Things that I need to do to build Clue: 
- Make lists for: 
    - Characters :white_check_mark:
    - Weapons :white_check_mark:
    - Rooms :white_check_mark:
- Make the gameboard navigatable.:white_check_mark:
    - Players can only move to rooms adjacent to the room that they are in at the beginning of their turn or through one of the corner secret passages.  
- Generate a random murder :white_check_mark:
- Allow players to make suggestions :white_check_mark:
- Allow players to make an accusation and end the game. :white_check_mark:
- Show Clues :white_check_mark:

### How to play: 
- Run `python play_clue.py` The game will give you all instructions on what to do

### Variances from real Clue
- No hallways or dice rolls

### Code Louisville Project Requirements Met
- Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
- Create a class, then create at least one object of that class and populate it with data. The value of at least one object must be used somewhere in your code
- Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
- Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in your code.

### Things still to do:
- Allow the user to determine how many computer players there are instead of automatically having two computer players. 
- Add error-handling for when players enter numbers in their player-picking, guess, or accusation that are greater than the options.

- When I couldn't figure out how to divide the cards into a certain number subsets: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2130016/splitting-a-list-into-n-parts-of-approximately-equal-length/37414115#37414115)
